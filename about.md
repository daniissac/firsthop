I'm a network engineer, educator, and content creator passionate about making computer networking accessible to everyone. I believe that understanding how networks work is fundamental to building better systems and applications.

## My Journey

I started my career in network operations, working with enterprise networks and ISPs. Over the years, I've worked with everything from small office networks to large-scale data center infrastructures. This hands-on experience taught me that networking doesn't have to be intimidatingâ€”it just needs to be explained clearly.

## What I Do

Currently, I work as a senior network engineer while creating educational content about networking concepts. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between complex networking theory and practical implementation.

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in:

- **Learning by doing** - Hands-on labs and real-world examples
- **Visual explanations** - Network diagrams and packet flows
- **Practical focus** - Skills you can use immediately
- **Building fundamentals** - Strong foundation before advanced topics

## Content Areas

I regularly write and create content about:

- **Network Fundamentals** - OSI model, TCP/IP, subnetting
- **Routing & Switching** - OSPF, BGP, VLANs, spanning tree
- **Network Security** - Firewalls, VPNs, network segmentation
- **Modern Networking** - SDN, cloud networking, containerization
- **Career Guidance** - Certifications, interview prep, skill development

## Certifications

- CCNP Enterprise
- CCNA
- CompTIA Network+
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect
